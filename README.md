# SpringBoot

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a Java framework that makes building web applications super easy and fast.

## Why do we use Spring Boot?

- **Quick Setup**: No complex configuration needed - just start coding
- **Built-in Server**: Comes with Tomcat server, so you don't need to install anything extra
- **Auto Configuration**: Automatically sets up common things like databases and security
- **Easy Testing**: Built-in tools to test your code
- **Production Ready**: Includes monitoring and health checks out of the box
- **Microservices**: Perfect for building small, independent services
- **Large Community**: Lots of help and resources available online

## Simple Example
Instead of writing 100+ lines of configuration, Spring Boot lets you create a web app in just a few lines:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

That's it! You have a running web application.
